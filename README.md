**TimeTracker** is a standalone Windows application built to help users efficiently manage their tasks, track the time they spend on those tasks, and gain insights into their productivity through built-in analytics. Developed in Python with a user interface crafted using Tkinter, TimeTracker delivers a clean, intuitive experience ideal for anyone seeking to improve their time management and task organization. The application is packaged as a Windows executable and does not require the user to have Python installed separately.

To install TimeTracker, users should first locate the folder named **Executable** included with the application distribution. Inside this folder is the installer file named `TimeTracker_Setup.exe`. To begin installation, simply double-click this file. The installer will launch a setup wizard that guides users through the installation process. If Windows displays a SmartScreen security warning, users can bypass it by clicking “More Info” and then selecting “Run anyway.” Once installed, TimeTracker will automatically create a shortcut on the user’s desktop labeled “TimeTracker,” allowing for quick access to the application.

TimeTracker offers a robust set of features focused on task and time management. Users can add new tasks, edit existing ones, delete tasks, and organize them into different categories or projects through the use of tags. Each task can be assigned a weight, making it easier to stay organized. In addition, TimeTracker includes a built-in timer system for tracking how much time is spent on each task. Users can start, pause, and stop timers independently for each task, and all time spent is automatically recorded for later analysis.

A key feature of TimeTracker is its analytics dashboard, which provides users with a visual and statistical breakdown of their productivity. Users can view how their time is distributed across different tasks, categories, or projects. These insights help identify productivity patterns and areas for improvement, empowering users to make informed decisions about how they manage their schedules and workloads.

Technically, TimeTracker is implemented using Python and relies on the Tkinter library for its graphical user interface. It uses SQLite3 for data storage, meaning that all user data is saved locally on the computer. There is no internet connection required to run the application, and no user data is sent to external servers. Users have the option to export and import their data, which is especially useful for backups or migrating data between systems. The application is packaged with PyInstaller, allowing it to run as a standalone `.exe` file without requiring any additional software or dependencies.

TimeTracker is an ideal solution for professionals, students, and anyone seeking a better handle on their daily activities. It combines essential features like task organization, time tracking, and performance analytics into one lightweight, easy-to-use tool. TimeTracker is built to help you get the most out of your time.
